# EV-Charging-Impact-Analysis - Project-3-Team-3-DE
U of T Bootcamp project on Data Engineering

Problem statement: 

How does the presence and accessibility of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure impact the adoption of EVs and contribute to reducing carbon emissions across different regions?

Sub questions:


How does the availability and accessibility of EV charging stations (from Dataset 2) correlate with the adoption rates of electric vehicles in various counties?

What are the usage patterns of electric vehicles in regions with high versus low access to EV charging stations, and how does this access impact the distribution and primary use of EVs?

What is the relationship between the increase in the number of EV charging stations and the reduction in carbon emissions by facilities within those regions?
